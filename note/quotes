We kept cutting the hair,
trying to stay afloat,


Make the payments,
tread the water day by day,
Day by day.


Most people think someone's
accused of a crime,


They haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial,
But it's not like that.

It's not that fast.

The wheels of justice turn slow.

They have the arraignment,
then the indictment,

And they entertain motions to dismiss
and postpone and change the venue...

And alter this and that
and the other.

They impanel a jury,
which bring more motions.

Then they set a trial date,
and then they change the date.

And then, often as not,
they'll change it again.

They got this guy in Germany.

Fritz something or other.

Or is it...
Maybe it's Werner.

Anyway...
He's got this theory.

You want to test something,
you know, scientifically...

How the planet
go 'round the sun,

What sunspots are made of,

Why the water
comes out of the tap...

Well, you gotta look at it.

But sometimes
you look at it...

Your looking changes it.

You can't know the reality
of what happened,

Or what would have happened,

If you hadn't stuck in
your own goddamn schnozz.

So there is no
"What happened."

Looking at something...

Changes it.

They call it
the uncertainty principle.

Sure, it sound screwy,
but even Einstein says
the guy's onto something.

Science.

Perception.

Reality.

Doubt.

Reasonable... doubt.

I'm saying that sometimes
the more you look,

the less you really know.

It's a fact, a proved fact.

In... In a way,

It's the only fact there is.

This Heinie even
wrote it out in numbers.

1. When trying to get the facts, I pretend that I am collecting this information not for myself, but for some other person. This helps me to take a cold, impartial view of the evidence. This helps me eliminate my emotions.

objective way(可观的说), his worries usually evaporate(消失) in the light of knowledge.

objective manner 可观的方式

拉康哲学的重点,幻想必须超越现实,因为在你得到的一瞬间　，你没办法，也不会在想要它，为了继续存在，欲望的客体必须永远无法达成，它想要的不是 它 本身，而是对 它 的幻想 欲望和疯狂幻想相辅相成，
You get the Kang’s points. Fantasies have to be unrealistic because the moment the second that you get what you seek you don’t, you can’t want it anymore. In order to continue to exist, desire must have its objects perpetually absent. It’s not the “it” that you want; it’s the fantasy of it. So desire supports crazy fantasies.

这正式巴斯所谓真正的快乐，来自对未来快乐的白日梦，不然我们怎么说“猎比杀更有趣” 或者 “小心你许下的愿” 不是因为你会得到它，而是因为你一旦得到它，你再也不会要它。
　　This is what Pas means when we say we are only truly happy when daydreaming about future happening. Or why we say “the hunt is sweeter than the kill.” or “be careful what you wish for.” not because you’ll get it, because you do not to want it once you do.

所以拉康给我们的教训是 心想事成的人 绝对不会快乐，最符合任性的真谛是 尽力活在你的想法和理想中，不要依据你达成，多少欲望来衡量你的生活，而该以获得多少真诚，怜悯，理性，甚至自我牺牲的时刻。
来衡量！
　　So the lesson of The Kang is “living by your wants will never make you happy.” what means to be fully human is to destrive to live by ideas and ideals. And not measure your life by what you tame in turns by desires but those small moments: so integrity, compassion, rationality, even so sacrifices.

因为最后，衡量我们生平轻重的唯一标准,而是取决于你怎么看待别人的生命　　
Because in the end the only way we can measure the significances of our own lives is by valuing the lives of others.
